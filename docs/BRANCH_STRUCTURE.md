**Branch Structure and Workflow**

This document outlines the structure and workflow of branches in this project. It helps ensure consistent development practices and simplifies collaboration.

**Branching Strategy**
1. **main branch**
 - **Purpose**: Represents stable, production-ready code.
 - **What** goes here: Only code that is ready for production.
 - **Merging**: Code is merged into main once it has passed all testing and is ready for release.

2. **backend-develop branch**
 - **Purpose**: Development of backend-related features, bug fixes, and updates.

 - **What goes here**: All backend changes are committed here.

 - **Merging**: When a feature is complete, it will be merged into main.

3. **frontend-develop branch**
 - **Purpose**: Development of frontend-related features, bug fixes, and updates.

 - **What goes here**: All frontend changes are committed here.

 - **Merging**: When a feature is complete, it will be merged into main.

4. **documentation branch**
 - **Purpose**: Branch for maintaining the project documentation (README, API docs, setup instructions, etc.).

 - **What goes here**: Any documentation updates or new documentation.

 - **Merging**: Changes are merged into main once the docs are updated.

5. **acceptance branch (Optional)**
 - **Purpose**: Final staging and QA testing before deployment to main.

 - **What goes here**: Integrated and tested code from backend-develop and frontend-develop.

 - **Merging**: Once everything is tested and approved, it is merged into main.

**Branch Workflow**
**Create Feature Branches:**

 - From either backend-develop or frontend-develop, create feature branches such as backend-feature-xyz or frontend-feature-abc.

 - Each feature should be developed and tested in its own branch.

**Merge Feature Branches:**

 - Once a feature is complete, create a pull request to merge it into backend-develop or frontend-develop.

 - Feature branches should be merged back into the appropriate development branch once reviewed and tested.

**Testing and Staging:**

 - After development on backend-develop and frontend-develop, merge the changes into the acceptance branch for integration testing.

 - After final approval in the acceptance branch, merge the code into main for production deployment.

**Documentation Updates:**

 - Any updates or changes to project documentation should be done in the documentation branch and merged into main when complete.

**Best Practices**
**Keep branches isolated:**

 - Don’t mix frontend and backend changes in the same branch.

**Frequent commits and pull requests:**

 - Commit often and push early to ensure progress is saved and reviewed.

**Use pull requests (PRs):**

 - Always create pull requests for merging into main to ensure code is reviewed and tested.

**Merge main into develop branches regularly:**

 - Keep backend-develop and frontend-develop branches up-to-date with main.
