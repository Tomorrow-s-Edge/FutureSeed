# ðŸ‘¤ About the Developer

Iâ€™m a junior fullstack developer based in the Netherlands. Iâ€™m currently enrolled in an HBO-level Software Development program and have completed:

- A fullstack development bootcamp  
- A junior developer  
- This final project as part of my practical portfolio  

I enjoy building functional tools with real-world impact, and Iâ€™m passionate about using AI, modern dev tools, and scalable architecture to solve problems in education and beyond.
